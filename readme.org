My emacs config. [[./config.org][config.org]] contains any configuration I've done,
which is loaded by org-babel on startup.

I use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] for package management, [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] for mail and
[[http://company-mode.github.io/][company]]/[[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]] for completion.
